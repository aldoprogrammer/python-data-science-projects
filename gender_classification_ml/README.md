## Why This Project?
- Hands-on gender classification example built with a transparent decision tree classifier.
- Beginner-friendly walkthrough that doubles as a machine learning tutorial you can share.
- Uses clean visualizations to explain height, weight, and shoe size patterns.
- Ideal for blog posts, portfolio pieces, workshops, classrooms, and hackathons.

## Features
- Interactive command line app to predict gender from height, weight, and shoe size.
- Automated setup scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux so anyone can run it fast.
- Feature importance chart, correlation heatmap, scatterplot, and boxplot for storytelling.
- Lightweight dataset that keeps the focus on the supervised learning workflow.
- Tested codebase (pytest) to help you practice test driven machine learning.

## Demo Preview

These visuals generate automatically when you run the project, making it easy to screenshot, share, or drop into a blog post about gender classification or decision trees.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- pytest for regression checks

## Quick Start

### Option 1: One command setup (recommended)

**Windows**
```bash
cd gender_classification_ml
setup_venv.bat
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
cd gender_classification_ml
chmod +x setup_venv.sh
./setup_venv.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual setup

```bash
cd gender_classification_ml
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies and run
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Run the tests (optional but encouraged):

```bash
python test_app.py
```

## Dataset
- 11 labeled samples focused on three easy to explain features:
  - Height (cm)
  - Weight (kg)
  - Shoe Size (EU)
- Target label: Gender (Male or Female)
- Perfect for teaching supervised learning, feature scaling discussions, or rapid experimentation.

## Evaluation And Results
- Uses a decision tree classifier to keep explainability front and center.
- Prints accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance every time you train.
- Swap in other algorithms (RandomForest, KNN, LogisticRegression) to compare performance and publish your findings.

## Roadmap And Ideas
- Deploy the model with Streamlit or Gradio for instant web demos.
- Expand the dataset with open data sources to improve generalization.
- Add hyperparameter tuning notebooks for GridSearchCV experiments.
- Record a walkthrough video or write a tutorial blog post and link it back here for cross promotion.

## Community And Contribution
- Issues and pull requests are open, so share your ideas, visualizations, or alternative models.
- Looking for first contributions? Start with doc improvements, dataset enhancements, or automated tests.
- Join the conversation in Discussions to brainstorm real world applications like retail, biometrics, or personalization.

## Spread The Word
- Star this repo to keep it on your radar and help others discover it.
- Share your remix on X, LinkedIn, or Reddit with the tag #MachineLearning and link back here.
- Mention this project in your next community talk or newsletter and drop the URL so we can amplify it.
- Cross promote with the companion project `twitter_or_x_sentiment_analysis/` for another portfolio ready machine learning build.
